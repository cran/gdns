Description: To address the problem of insecurity of 'UDP'-based 'DNS' requests,
    Google Public 'DNS' offers 'DNS' resolution over an encrypted 'HTTPS'
    connection. 'DNS'-over-'HTTPS' greatly enhances privacy and security
    between a client and a recursive resolver, and complements 'DNSSEC'
    to provide end-to-end authenticated DNS lookups. Functions that enable
    querying individual requests that bulk requests that return detailed
    responses and bulk requests are both provided. Support for reverse
    lookups is also provided. See
    <https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/dns-over-https> 
    for more information.
